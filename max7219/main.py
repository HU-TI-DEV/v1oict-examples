""" 
  Make sure the hardware is reset _after_ we have stable power.
  For this, we blink the built-in LED three times between init steps.
  This adds a delay that gives the power source time to get up to the necessary voltage.
  The Pico will be fine from 1.8V, but the LED matrix needs a higher voltage to work.
  This delay is important if we want to use e.g. a power bank or wall adaptor.
